**Goal:** Develop AI-driven DQ Insights, SQL automation, and cost optimization solutions using LLMs, ML, and scalable architectures.  

**Metrics & Action Plan:**  
- Build multiple **DQ Insights** versions (local Llama, MLflow, AWS SageMaker, Snowflake Cortex, Chinou) with a **pluggable framework**. Optimize model performance via **quantization**. *(Target: Reduce processing time by 30%, maintain <5% error rate in AI-generated SQL & graphs).*  
- Train a **SQL classification model** for rule-based automation. *(Target: 90% accuracy, reduce manual SQL validation by 40%.)*  
- Automate **Data Lineage** with **XGBoost & Sentence Transformer**. *(Target: 85% accuracy, 50% manual effort reduction.)*  
- Develop **Snowflake Cost Optimization AI Chatbot**. *(Target: 20% cost reduction, 25% improved forecasting.)*  
- Implement **Sensitivity Classification & Description Autofill** using ML & Chinou. *(Target: 92% accuracy, 60% manual effort reduction.)*  
- Deliver **10+ AI projects**, writing **production-ready, scalable code**. *(Target: 95% uptime, 100% on-time delivery.)*
